**** `M-S-<right>'     (`org-demote-subtree')- Demote the current subtree by one level.
**** `C-c C-x C-y'     (`org-paste-subtree') - Yank subtree from kill ring.  This does modify the level of the subtree 
**** C-c ^'     (`org-sort')
**** C-c *'     (`org-toggle-heading
**** C-c / r ; C-c C-c - sparse trees. When called with a `C-u'   prefix argument, previous highlights are kept, so several calls to this command can be stacked.
**** M-g n -next sparse
*****      (setq org-agenda-custom-commands 
  '(("f" occur-tree "FIXME"))) will define the key `C-c a f' as a shortcut for creating a sparse tree
  matching the string `FIXME'.
***** Or you can use `C-c C-e C-v' to export only the visible part of the document and print the resulting file.
**** lists unordered                                                      :g:
     :plainlists:
      Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.
      * _Unordered_ list items start with `-', `+', or `*'(1)  as bullets.

      * _Ordered_ list items start with a numeral followed by either a
	period or a right parenthesis(2), such as `1.' or `1)'(3).  If you
	want a list to start with a different value (e.g., 20), start the
	text of the item with `[@20]'(4).  Those constructs can be used in
	any item of the list in order to enforce a particular numbering.

      * _Description_ list items are unordered list items, and contain the
	separator ` :: ' to distinguish the description _term_ from the
	description. - BNF

      Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on
   the first line.  In particular, if an ordered list reaches number
   `10.', then the 2-digit numbers must be written left-aligned with the
   other numbers in the list.  An item ends before the next line that is
   less or equally indented than its bullet/number.




	** Lord of the Rings
           My favorite scenes are (in this order)
           1. The attack of the Rohirrim
           2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
              + this was already my favorite scene in the book
              + I really like Miranda Otto.
           3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
              - on DVD only
              He makes a really funny face when it happens.
           But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
           Important actors in this film are:
           - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
           - Sean Astin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
             him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.

[[info:org#Handling%20links][info:org#Handling links]]
:links:
     [[linkword:tag][description]]
where the tag is optional.  The linkword must be a word, starting with
a letter, followed by letters, numbers, `-', and `_'.  Abbreviations
are resolved according to the information in the variable
`org-link-abbrev-alist' that relates the linkwords to replacement text.
Here is an example:

     (setq org-link-abbrev-alist
       '(("bugzilla"  . "http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=")
         ("url-to-ja" . "http://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=en&tl=ja&u=%h")
         ("google"    . "http://www.google.com/search?q=")
         ("gmap"      . "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=%s")
         ("omap"      . "http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=%s&polygon=1")
         ("ads"       . "http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?author=%s&db_key=AST")))

   If the replacement text contains the string `%s', it will be
replaced with the tag.  Using `%h' instead of `%s' will url-encode the
tag (see the example above, where we need to encode the URL parameter.)
Using `%(my-function)' will pass the tag to a custom function, and
replace it by the resulting string.

   If the replacement text doesn't contain any specifier, the tag will
simply be appended in order to create the link.

   Instead of a string, you may also specify a function that will be
called with the tag as the only argument to create the link.

   With the above setting, you could link to a specific bug with
`[[bugzilla:129]]', search the web for `OrgMode' with
`[[google:OrgMode]]', show the map location of the Free Software
Foundation `[[gmap:51 Franklin Street, Boston]]' or of Carsten office
`[[omap:Science Park 904, Amsterdam, The Netherlands]]' and find out
what the Org author is doing besides Emacs hacking with
`[[ads:Dominik,C]]'.

   If you need special abbreviations just for a single Org buffer, you
can define them in the file with

     #+LINK: bugzilla  http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=
     #+LINK: google    http://www.google.com/search?q=%s

In-buffer completion (*note Completion::) can be used after `[' to
complete link abbreviations.  You may also define a function that
implements special (e.g., completion) support for inserting such a link
with `C-c C-l'.  Such a function should not accept any arguments, and
return the full link with prefix.  You can add a completion function to
a link like this:
     (org-link-set-parameters ``type'' :complete #'some-function)

:END:
*** links with searches
     [[file:~/code/main.c::255]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::*My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::#my-custom-id]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::/regexp/]]

`255'
     Jump to line 255.

`My Target'
     Search for a link target `<<My Target>>', or do a text search for
     `my target', similar to the search in internal links, see *note
     Internal links::.  In HTML export (*note HTML export::), such a
     file link will become an HTML reference to the corresponding named
     anchor in the linked file.

`*My Target'
     In an Org file, restrict search to headlines.

`#my-custom-id'
     Link to a heading with a `CUSTOM_ID' property

`/regexp/'
     Do a regular expression search for `regexp'.  This uses the Emacs
     command `occur' to list all matches in a separate window.  If the
     target file is in Org mode, `org-occur' is used to create a sparse
     tree with the matches.
**** org protocol 
:orgprotocol:
 "org-protocol:/sub-protocol:/" triggers actions associated with sub-protocol through the custom variable org-protocol-protocol-alist.

It comes with four predefined handlers:

org-protocol-store-link
    triggered through the sub-protocol "store-link". Stores an Org-link and pushes the URL to the kill-ring.
org-protocol-capture
    Fill a CAPTURE buffer with information gathered somewhere else. This handler is triggered through the "capture" sub-protocol and uses the function org-capture.
org-protocol-remember
    Fills a remember buffer with information gathered somewhere else. This handler is triggered through the "remember" sub-protocol and still available for backward compatibility. This handler uses org-remember. Use the current org-protocol-capture.
org-protocol-open-source
    "open-source". Maps URLs to local filenames. Use this to open sources of already published contents in emacs for editing. 
READ TUTORIAL FOR HANDLERS!!
:END:

*** custom searched 
for a particular file type, and to do the
search for the string in the file.  Using `add-hook', these functions
need to be added to the hook variables
`org-create-file-search-functions' and
`org-execute-file-search-functions'.

`C-c C-x 0     (`org-timer-start')'
     Start or reset the relative timer.  By default, the timer is set
     to 0.  When called with a `C-u' prefix, prompt the user for a
     starting offset.  If there is a timer string at point, this is
     taken as the default, providing a convenient way to restart taking
     notes after a break in the process.  When called with a double
     prefix argument `C-u C-u', change all timer strings in the active
     region by a certain amount.  This can be used to fix timer strings
     if the timer was not started at exactly the right moment.  

`C-c C-x ;     (`org-timer-set-timer')'
     Start a countdown timer.  The user is prompted for a duration.
     `org-timer-default-timer' sets the default countdown value.  Giving
     a numeric prefix argument overrides this default value.  This
     command is available as `;' in agenda buffers.

     Call the command `org-capture'.  Note that this key binding is
     global and not active by default: you need to install it.  If you
     have templates defined *note Capture templates::, it will offer
     these templates for selection or use a new Org outline node as the
     default template.  It will insert the template into the target
     file and switch to an indirect buffer narrowed to this new node.
     You may then insert the information you want.

`C-c C-c     (`org-capture-finalize')'
     Once you have finished entering information into the capture
     buffer, `C-c C-c' will return you to the window configuration
     before the capture process, so that you can resume your work
     without further distraction.  When called with a prefix arg,
     finalize and then jump to the captured item.

`C-c C-w     (`org-capture-refile')'
     Finalize the capture process by refiling (*note Refile and copy::)
     the note to a different place.  Please realize that this is a
     normal refiling command that will be executed--so the cursor
     position at the moment you run this command is important.  If you
     have inserted a tree with a parent and children, first move the
     cursor back to the parent.  Any prefix argument given to this
     command will be passed on to the `org-refile' command.

`C-c C-k     (`org-capture-kill')'
     Abort the capture process and return to the previous state.

   You can also call `org-capture' in a special way from the agenda,
using the `k c' key combination.

**** TODO templates C-c c C   capture templates definitions
     :templatesdefinition:
look at an example.  Say you would like to use one template to create
general TODO entries, and you want to put these entries under the
heading `Tasks' in your file `~/org/gtd.org'.  Also, a date tree in the
file `journal.org' should capture journal entries.  A possible
configuration would look like:

     (setq org-capture-templates
      '(("t" "Todo" entry (file+headline "~/org/gtd.org" "Tasks")
             "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a")
        ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/org/journal.org")
             "* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")))

If you then press `C-c c t', Org will prepare the template for you like
this:
     * TODO
       [[file:LINK TO WHERE YOU INITIATED CAPTURE]]


     :END:

automatically commit changes when it sees them. 
C-c C-a
**** moving copying
`C-c M-w     (`org-copy')'
     Copying works like refiling, except that the original note is not
     deleted.  

`C-c C-w     (`org-refile')'
     Refile the entry or region at point.  This command offers possible
     locations for refiling the entry and lets you select one with
     completion.  The item (or all items in the region) is filed below
     the target heading as a subitem.  Depending on
     `org-reverse-note-order', it will be either the first or last
     subitem.
**** archiving
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ORDERED:  t
     :END:
     :archive:
     `C-c C-x C-a 

     `C-u C-c C-x C-s'
     Check if any direct children of the current headline could be
     moved to the archive.  To do this, each subtree is checked for
     open TODO entries.  If none are found, the command offers to move
     it to the archive location.  If the cursor is _not_ on a headline
     when this command is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.  

     `C-u C-u C-c C-x C-s'
     As above, but check subtree for timestamps instead of TODO
     entries.  The command will offer to archive the subtree if it
     _does_ contain a timestamp, and that timestamp is in the past.

     The default archive location is a file in the same directory as the
     current file, with the name derived by appending `_archive' to the
     current file name.

     
INTERNAL ARCHIVING:     
`C-c C-x a     (`org-toggle-archive-tag')'
     Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  When the tag is
     set, the headline changes to a shadowed face, and the subtree
     below it is hidden.  

`C-u C-c C-x a'
     Check if any direct children of the current headline should be
     archived.  To do this, each subtree is checked for open TODO
     entries.  If none are found, the command offers to set the ARCHIVE
     tag for the child.  If the cursor is _not_ on a headline when this
     command is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.

For example:

     Produce a preview image of the LaTeX fragment at point and overlay
     it over the source code.  If there is no fragment at point,
     process all fragments in the current entry (between two
     headlines).  When called with a prefix argument, process the
     entire subtree.  When called with two prefix arguments, or when
     the cursor is before the first headline, process the entire buffer.  

`C-c C-c'
     Remove the overlay preview images.

   You can turn on the previewing of all LaTeX fragments in a file with

     #+STARTUP: latexpreview
****    cdlatex 
   * Environment templates can be inserted with `C-c {'.

   * The <TAB> key will do template expansion if the cursor is inside a
     LaTeX fragment(1).  For example, <TAB> will expand `fr' to
     `\frac{}{}' and position the cursor correctly inside the first
     brace.  Another <TAB> will get you into the second brace.  Even
     outside fragments, <TAB> will expand environment abbreviations at
     the beginning of a line.  For example, if you write `equ' at the
     beginning of a line and press <TAB>, this abbreviation will be
     expanded to an `equation' environment.  To get a list of all
     abbreviations, type `M-x cdlatex-command-help RET'.

*** autoewaluacja kodu autoevaluation 
-- User Option: org-confirm-babel-evaluate
          When `t', Org prompts the user for confirmation before
          executing each code block.  When `nil', Org executes code
          blocks without prompting the user for confirmation.  When
          this option is set to a custom function, Org invokes the
          function with these two arguments: the source code language
          and the body of the code block.  The custom function must
          return either a `t' or `nil', which determines if the user is
          prompted.  Each source code language can be handled
          separately through this function argument.

     For example, this function enables execution of `ditaa' code
     +blocks without prompting:

          (defun my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body)
            (not (string= lang "ditaa")))  ; don't ask for ditaa
          (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate 'my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate)

Following `shell' and `elisp' links
     Org has two link types that can also directly evaluate code (*note
     External links::).  Because such code is not visible, these links
     have a potential risk.  Org therefore prompts the user when it
     encounters such links.  The customization variables are:

      -- User Option: org-confirm-shell-link-function
          Function that prompts the user before executing a shell link.

      -- User Option: org-confirm-elisp-link-function
          Function that prompts the user before executing an Emacs Lisp
          link.

He makes a really funny face when it happens.        But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.

          him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.

the opposite direction.


LEVELS variable ‘compilation-skip-threshold’ controls
this.  The default value, 1, means to skip anything less important than
a warning.  A value of 2 means to skip anything less important than an
error, while 0 means not to skip any messages.

*edebug*
tracing trace: ‘*edebug-trace*’ buffer, edebug-trace t

‘cust-print.el’
edebug-print-level

‘c’
     Exit the debugger and continue execution.  This resumes execution
     of the program as if the debugger had never been entered (aside
     from any side-effects that you caused by changing variable values
     or data structures while inside the debugger).

‘d’
     Continue execution, but enter the debugger the next time any Lisp
     function is called.  This allows you to step through the
     subexpressions of an expression, seeing what values the
     subexpressions compute, and what else they do.

     The stack frame made for the function call which enters the
     debugger in this way will be flagged automatically so that the
     debugger will be called again when the frame is exited.  You can
     use the ‘u’ command to cancel this flag.

‘b’
     Flag the current frame so that the debugger will be entered when
     the frame is exited.  Frames flagged in this way are marked with
     stars in the backtrace buffer.

‘u’
     Don’t enter the debugger when the current frame is exited.  This
     cancels a ‘b’ command on that frame.  The visible effect is to
     remove the star from the line in the backtrace buffer.

‘j’
     Flag the current frame like ‘b’.  Then continue execution like ‘c’,
     but temporarily disable break-on-entry for all functions that are
     set up to do so by ‘debug-on-entry’.

‘e’
     Read a Lisp expression in the minibuffer, evaluate it (with the
     relevant lexical environment, if applicable), and print the value
     in the echo area.  The debugger alters certain important variables,
     and the current buffer, as part of its operation; ‘e’ temporarily
     restores their values from outside the debugger, so you can examine
     and change them.  This makes the debugger more transparent.  By
     contrast, ‘M-:’ does nothing special in the debugger; it shows you
     the variable values within the debugger.

‘R’
     Like ‘e’, but also save the result of evaluation in the buffer
     ‘*Debugger-record*’.

‘q’
     Terminate the program being debugged; return to top-level Emacs
     command execution.

     If the debugger was entered due to a ‘C-g’ but you really want to
     quit, and not debug, use the ‘q’ command.

‘r’
     Return a value from the debugger.  The value is computed by reading
     an expression with the minibuffer and evaluating it.

     The ‘r’ command is useful when the debugger was invoked due to exit
     from a Lisp call frame (as requested with ‘b’ or by entering the
     frame with ‘d’); then the value specified in the ‘r’ command is
     used as the value of that frame.  It is also useful if you call
     ‘debug’ and use its return value.  Otherwise, ‘r’ has the same
     effect as ‘c’, and the specified return value does not matter.

     You can’t use ‘r’ when the debugger was entered due to an error.

‘l’
     Display a list of functions that will invoke the debugger when
     called.  This is a list of functions that are set to break on entry
     by means of ‘debug-on-entry’.

‘v’
     Toggle the display of local variables of the current stack frame.


‘h’
     Proceed to the stop point near where point is (‘edebug-goto-here’).

‘f’
     Run the program for one expression (‘edebug-forward-sexp’).

‘o’
     Run the program until the end of the containing sexp
     (‘edebug-step-out’).

‘i’
     Step into the function or macro called by the form after point
     (‘edebug-step-in’).

**** debugging Emacs
***** gdb
emacs i gdb przy pliku .gdbinit!

 If Emacs hangs, or seems to be stuck in some infinite loop, typing
"kill -TSTP PID", where PID is the Emacs process ID, will cause GDB to
kick in, provided that you run under GDB.

 Getting control to the debugger

`Fsignal' is a very useful place to put a breakpoint in.
All Lisp errors go through there.

It is useful, when debugging, to have a guaranteed way to return to
the debugger at any time.  When using X, this is easy: type C-z at the
window where Emacs is running under GDB, and it will stop Emacs just
as it would stop any ordinary program.  When Emacs is running in a
terminal, things are not so easy.

The src/.gdbinit file in the Emacs distribution arranges for SIGINT
(C-g in Emacs) to be passed to Emacs and not give control back to GDB.
On modern POSIX systems, you can override that with this command:

   handle SIGINT stop nopass

After this `handle' command, SIGINT will return control to GDB.  If
you want the C-g to cause a QUIT within Emacs as well, omit the `nopass'.

A technique that can work when `handle SIGINT' does not is to store
the code for some character into the variable stop_character.  Thus,

    set stop_character = 29

makes Control-] (decimal code 29) the stop character.
Typing Control-] will cause immediate stop.  You cannot
use the set command until the inferior process has been started.
Put a breakpoint early in `main', or suspend the Emacs,
to get an opportunity to do the set command.

When Emacs is running in a terminal, it is sometimes useful to use a separate
terminal for the debug session.  This can be done by starting Emacs as usual,
then attaching to it from gdb with the `attach' command which is explained in
the node "Attach" of the GDB manual.

 Examining Lisp object values.

When you have a live process to debug, and it has not encountered a
fatal error, you can use the GDB command `pr'.  First print the value
in the ordinary way, with the `p' command.  Then type `pr' with no
arguments.  This calls a subroutine which uses the Lisp printer.

You can also use `pp value' to print the emacs value directly.
***** DONE Edebug

****** ‘edebug-all-defs C-M-x 
When you invoke command ‘C-M-x’ (‘eval-defun’) with a prefix argument
on a function definition, it instruments the definition before
evaluating it.  (This does not modify the source code itself.)  If the
variable ‘edebug-all-defs’ is non-‘nil’, that inverts the meaning of the
prefix argument: in this case, ‘C-M-x’ instruments the definition
_unless_ it has a prefix argument.
****** I-instrument callee, i-instrument and jump
****** TODO instrument macro (declare)

‘e EXP <RET>’
     Evaluate expression EXP in the context outside of Edebug
     (‘edebug-eval-expression’).  That is, Edebug tries to minimize its

     Evaluate expression EXP in the context of Edebug itself
     (‘eval-expression’).

   Matcher Selection
       -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular expression (ERE, see below).

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Interpret PATTERN as a list of fixed strings (instead of regular expressions), separated by newlines, any of which is to
              be matched.

       -G, --basic-regexp
              Interpret PATTERN as a basic regular expression (BRE, see below).  This is the default.

       -P, --perl-regexp
              Interpret the pattern as a Perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE).  This is highly experimental and grep -P may  warn
              of unimplemented features.

   Matching Control
       -e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN
              Use  PATTERN  as  the pattern.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the -f (--file) option, search
              for all patterns given.  This option can be used to protect a pattern beginning with “-”.

       -f FILE, --file=FILE
              Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with  the  -e  (--regexp)
              option, search for all patterns given.  The empty file contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in both the PATTERN and the input files.

       -v, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

       -w, --word-regexp
              Select  only  those lines containing matches that form whole words.  The test is that the matching substring must either
              be at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a non-word constituent character.  Similarly, it must be either  at  the
              end  of  the line or followed by a non-word constituent character.  Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and
              the underscore.

       -x, --line-regexp
              Select only those matches that exactly  match  the  whole  line.   For  a  regular  expression  pattern,  this  is  like
              parenthesizing the pattern and then surrounding it with ^ and $.

       -y     Obsolete synonym for -i.

   General Output Control
       -c, --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.  With the -v, --invert-match option
              (see below), count non-matching lines.

       --color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]
              Surround the matched (non-empty) strings, matching lines, context lines, file names, line  numbers,  byte  offsets,  and
              separators (for fields and groups of context lines) with escape sequences to display them in color on the terminal.  The
              colors are defined by the environment variable GREP_COLORS.  The deprecated environment  variable  GREP_COLOR  is  still
              supported, but its setting does not have priority.  WHEN is never, always, or auto.

       -L, --files-without-match
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which no output would normally have been printed.
              The scanning will stop on the first match.
